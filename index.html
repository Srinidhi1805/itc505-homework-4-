            <h2>Font Choices</h2>
            <p>
                I used a straightforward, easily readable font family for this project. For the entire document, I used "Times New Roman" as the default font. As readability is vital for academic papers, this decision was made to ensure that the content is readable and accessible.

            <h2>Heading and Text Sizes</h2>
            <p>
                Headings are essential for organizing the text and directing readers. In order to draw attention to the main title, I made code>h1>/code>'s font size larger than code>h2> and code>h3>. For ease of reading, the major text content's font size is maintained at a conventional and comfortable level.

                Heading size : h1- 24px, h2- 20px , h3- 18px;
                Body size: 16px;

            <h2>Color Choices</h2>
            <p>
               To preserve a polished and academic impression, I went with a straightforward color scheme. To provide a clear hierarchy in the paper, the headings are dark and bold. To make the table easier to read, alternate rows in the table's rows have a different backdrop color. I selected a separate color for the links to make them stand out.
                
                h1 - Blue;
                h2 - green;

            <h2>Margin and Padding</h2>
            <p>
                I applied a slight margin to the entire document to create some spacing between the content and the edges of the screen, making it more visually pleasing. I also added padding to the table cells to ensure that the content is well-spaced and doesn't appear too crowded.

            <p>
                In my original HTML document, I used a <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag for the title of the essay due to aesthetic considerations. However, I understand the importance of semantic markup, and to maintain proper document structure, I have changed the title to use the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, which represents the highest-level heading and is more appropriate for the essay title.
            </p>

    <section>
        <h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
        
			<p>The study focuses on the impact of social media on youth. Technology and innovation are regarded to be the very prime importance for human life, and we must know how to handle It accordingly. It is vital to teach young people about the use of social media to Enhance in their careers and self-improvement. Technology has managed to secure within our body, human brain and even emotions.   How does social media effect youth[1] stated that social media, like a coin, have a beneficial and negative effect on young people.  It encourages youth to succeed and pull them down, but youngsters need to be alert. Youth communicate with many individuals and support themselves in their professions. Social media lets youth share their views with others[2].</p>		
			<p>Social media promotes deceptive posts, messaging, photographs that give rise to conflicts in between them. Such posts are deteriorating the affiliations and relations between nations. As youngsters are immature, they are becoming victims of cyberbullying. This impacts young people mental and physical health and may also leads to depression and self-harm[3]. Because there is a lack of confidentiality and security on the social media platforms, it is possible that a third party would misuse sensitive information. Studies have found that children and teenagers benefit from improving Communication, social linkages, and technological skills. Social media is really a significant aspect in this world. In general, social media is described like any interactive medium or application which enables people to communicate digitally and could be differentiated from conventional media (e.g., television) by the way that users can both access and produce content[4]. Within this broad description, social media can include websites (e.g.,Facebook, WhatsApp, snapchat, TikTok), instant messaging apps, mobile gaming tools, YouTube, and more. </p>
			<p>The more extensive usage social media is correlated with numerous mental health issues which include anxiety of self-image and eating disorders and other problems. In addition, outcomes of these studies have indeed been contradictory, with several suggesting a slight but substantial negative influence of social media use on mental health.  Increased occurrence of certain mental health conditions, such as depression and suicide have risen dramatically amongst adolescents in recent years, with suicide rates in youth aged 10-24 rising by 56% between 2007 and 2017[4], [5].  One growing problem that really has captured the interest of young people is body dissatisfaction. Low self - esteem refers to unwelcome and negative thoughts and feelings about one's beauty that tend to rise in our younger generation. Social networking promotes the concept of a perfect body, as it can be connected to nearly all channels of mass media.   Anything from height, weight, body size and body form has become a nuanced aspect of this ideal, usually women are ordinary[6]. </p>
			<p>The goals in these perfect body images and ads. Much of the  videos  show  thin  breathing  and  bone  suction,  which causes the viewer to have poor weight and often to have a body with protruding collarbones, spines and  ribs, which is also the primary cause of  anorexia. Whereas  an optimistic trend  can  often  be  seen  on  social  media,  which  is  a fitspiration that  encourages a  person to have a  safe and fit body[7], [8]. </p>
			<p>Two  cross-section  studies  of  US  and  German  school students,  showed  that researchers who spent as much time on Facebook's social media site were more often to support Starting to  feel envy  or fearing like  others  on their  social media platform were good than they have been. "FOMO" —fear  of  missing  out— was  described  as"  a  pervasive apprehension  that  others  may  have  profitable  reviews  of which one is absent “and has been associated with multiplied strain associated with Facebook use[9],[10]. </p>
			<p>A systematic overview of  research observed that  use of social  media  turned into  related  to  body photo  issues  and disordered  consuming.  In  a  randomized  examine,  girl individuals  suggested  greater  bad  temper  after  simply  10 mins of Perusing their Facebook profile in contrast to those who have visited the personality-neutral website exploitation. In addition, participants who were over-evaluated appeared to make An escalated decision to improve the look of their face, hair or skin after spending time on Facebook, compared to those who were surfing the control website[11], [12]. An observational look found that  spending quite a  few hours a week on the use of electronic media was inversely correlated with self-reported satisfaction, life pleasure and self-esteem, while time is spent on off-screen sports (in-character social relationships,  recreational  activities or  exercise,  traditional media,  homework,  religious  services,  paid  work)  was undeniably  correlated with  Mental  well-being,  among  the youth. Other data analysis has associated spending more than 2  hours  an  afternoon  on  social  media  platforms  and personalized digital devices with excessive suicide costs and depressive signs among  teenage  girls, and  although young people  who  have  endured  high  levels  of  face-to  -  face socialization have been particularly affected by the negative effects of even more time on-line[5]. </p>
			<p>In  a  14-day,  longitudinal,  cross-over  trial  with managed situations,  the  use  of  digital  screens  earlier  than bedtime has been Sleep has been  shown to  be disrupted in many approaches: longer sleep time and decreased sleepiness during  the  night,  reduced  melatonin  secretion,  circadian clock delay,  reduced  amount and  fast-moving  sleep  in  the eye,  and  reduced  alertness  in  the  next  morning.  A comprehensive  evaluation  and  semantic  analysis that supported studies on the  allegiance among compact display screen-primarily  dependent  electronic  gadgets  and  sleep implications,  found  but  the  use  of  social  media  was associated  with  decreased  duration  and  improved  sleep quality and extended sleep during the daytime hours. Word of all the sheer presence of portable screen-primarily based electronic gadgets in the bedroom made into seen to disrupt sleep[6]. </p>

    <!-- Literature Review -->
    <section>
        <h2>II. LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
        <p>Despite  the  interruption  from  the  research,  youth are forming pleasant  and social  links with  the community  that exists  around  .  One  of  the  critical consequences  of  these platforms  is  the  students  ’  academic  success,  and  many longitudinal studies  have  found that  excessive uninventive time spent on social media has had a poor influence on the student's degrees. It was observed that 82.6 per cent of young people believed that social media had a strong effect on their social  behaviour[2],  [10].  Many  young  people  use  the internet before or after anything they do, do not engage with their peers, but connect with their social friends and become less social. The majority of young people use social media for social rather than educational reasons. Social networking sites  influence  the  vocabulary  of  young  people  to  some degree.  65  per  cent  claim  that  social  media  lets  them establish a connection with their socially linked peers, and 33 per  cent  agree  that  social  media  sites  Most  of  the young people use social  media before or  after every activity they do, they do not interact with their fellows but communicate with their social friends and are becoming less social[13]. </p>

    <!-- Problem Statement-->
    <section>
        <h2>III. PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>Social media networking of adolescents have a vital role to play in the advent and development of  psychopathology. Online  community  social  interactions  are described  as significant risk factors for mental health issues. Social media users  are  radically  subjected to  idealized  self-shows.  This poses a danger to youngsters' potential to appear superficial, but the awful effect may depend on a form of social media interaction[3].  </p>
		
		<h3>A. POTENTIAL RISKS </h3>
		<p>Youth who actively keep up-to-date (i.e. self-directed use of  social  media)  may  additionally  work  to  obtain advantageous feedback and to search for affirmation and for that reason, display better vanity, whereas young people who mainly view and respond to different posts(i.e. other-oriented use  of  social  media)  are  introduced  to  these  idealized displays, although they no longer get great reviews on their very own appearance, which may also lead to a fall in self-esteem.  Cyber  victimization, or  the  feeling of  becoming  a victim of cyber peer abuse, has frequently been reported as correlated  with  greater  rates  of  self-harm  and  suicidal behaviour,  as  well  as  stress  related  issues[14],[15].  Other forms  of  peer  encounters  in  social  media,  such  as  social isolation  and  online dispute  can  also put  young people  at risk. Study has shown 41% of teenagers acknowledge using a smart phone  during sleep, and 36%  reported waking up  to check their phone in the night[16],[14].</p>

		<h3>B. DEPRESSION AND SELF-HARM IN ADOLESCENTS </h3>
		<p>Although entirely population-based research proposes a correlation between the use of social media and academic discomfort among teenagers, the influence of such technology can also differ between individuals and may even have. a much lower risk of harm, such as it is indicated by a growing literature on experimental research. Girls prefer to invest more time on social media than boys, have more publicity about cyberbullying, and have a propensity to revel in more  health implications[17], [18] that is consistent with the recent epidemiological findings indicate that depressive signs and symptoms, self-harm and suicidal thoughts have specifically increased in young girls[19].</p>

		<h3>C. BENEFITS OF USING SOCIAL MEDIA</h3>
		<p>There are a variety of possible advantages Connected with the use of social media, include opportunities for entertainment, discovery of personality and artistic expression. Among the most specifically stated advantages of social media use is social interaction, with 81% of teenagers claiming that social media helps them to feel at home. It can also provide resources for some young people to obtain online social support, especially to access to similar peer communities[20]. </p>
		<p>Social media platform enables one to share or connect with others . It helps a person from one side of the earth to communicate and discuss things with a person in the other side of the earth. This is not just a form of entertainment; it is also effective. One should take advantage of this in order to achieve optimal outcome in education. Social media offers its users with a platform to get formulated. Internal effectiveness, which relates to individuals  own capacity to recognize and engage in politics, and external effectiveness, or confidence in the accountability of political officials and organizations to citizens' demands[21]. </p>
		<p>Students should use social media to promote social consciousness and compassion.  social networking sites can allow young people to get in contact with peers. Social media sites encourage youngsters to live their life unaffected.</p>
		<p>In reality, several organisations have developed their own Facebook accounts   for  Sharing details with many other people. In addition, its effect on recruiting has indeed been increasing. Through creating profile pages on social media in particular LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter, together with the company's website, businesses are seeking suitable applicants for the positions available in their organisation[20], [22]</p>

    <!-- MAKING SOCIAL MEDIA TO USE IN A BETTER AND SAFE WAY -->
    <section>
        <h2>IV. MAKING SOCIAL MEDIA TO USE IN A BETTER AND SAFE WAY</h2>
		<p>Encouraging families to be pre-emptively extremely concerned in limiting kids and teens’ usage of smartphones and other mobile devices can nonetheless be helpful, for the reason that social media use tends to appear as complex when it outstrips one to two hours per day, , open debate focusing on high-quality interaction and directing is presumably excellent for mitigating internet-associated risks for children; moreover, easiest five of the covered researches pertained to social media, that were cantered totally on pass-sectional surveys. It is indeed worth informing parent that they associate smartphone use with their personal conduct; a retrospective observation has shown that intense parental mobile phone usage has turned into a connection with a worse kind of contact with their children.[5], [23]. Youngsters and their parents may be inspired to restrict the use of cell phones and social media. This will wish to consist of such steps as the use of social media just for fixed hours, and preferably handiest hallways and drawing room areas within the household. A further motivating factor could be to examine data displaying a negative influence of smartphones on getting to know, and the advantage on instructional results when telephones are put away while analysing, preferably in some other space[15], [24]. </p>
		<p>An inspirational questioning strategy may be helpful to assist young humans continue to make improvements to the routine of online activity. Cognitive therapy is an approach with proven effectiveness for young people with opioid use that can be effective for adolescents  who appear to have poor self-control with their usage of social media or phones[25].  This methodology ought to contain open, non-judgmental evaluation of all facets of an adolescents’ virtual life, any teens can advantage from habit reversal schooling to cope with compulsive usage, consisting of getting day by day “on screen time” that can be step by step extended. Reporting proof that a randomized controlled trial located that participants allocated to no longer the use of Facebook described significantly more “lifestyles satisfaction” and considerable  emotions later  one week, relative to controls that were ordered to keep the use of the website as usual, could be beneficial in the conduct of trade. Youngsters should be allowed to tell their friends that they will be taking a short break or in any other situation, proscribing their use of social media[26]. Talking with children about better methods of communicating, along with meeting in person or also interacting without pause with the assistance of mobile phones, would wish to help with plans to bridge the social media void, supported by discussion of proofs that in-person contact will further defend academic fitness.</p>
		<p>More generally, public-focused campaigns should provide training on the effects of the tricky use of new technology and encourage healthier actions in this regard. Various social media sites have enforced prohibitions and regulations on self-harm related posts. A comparative analysis of awareness-raising enterprises affecting a total of sixty-six children determined that while children appreciated equality[6]. </p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
        <h2>IV.CONCLUSION </h2>
		<p>New media have been established over the last decades. An increasingly critical place in the lives of young people, providing numerous challenges and opportunities. As the impact of new media continues to expand, it will be important to develop evidence-based approaches to encouraging and making more effective use of social media in young people Given the value of attractive teens in alleviating possible social networking damage, a preventive tactic, will be counter-productive. Indeed for today's youth who have no longer understand the world  without social networking sites, digital interactions are the standard and the future benefits of online accessibility to efficient analytical medical information.—along with digital exposure, imagination, self-Consciousness, feeling of identity and civic participation are the norm. —Along with being limited to channels such as disaster lines and the Internet speech treatments, it cannot be dismissed[22], [27]. Nevertheless, young people today could gain from validated character and systemic interventions to help them resolve the challenges of using social media and digital media, to shield themselves from damage and to use social networking sites in a manner that supports their mental wellbeing, against the past tradition of policy proposals aimed at addressing social, cultural and monetary issues that underpin the family[28], [29]. </p>
    </section>

    <!-- RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE WORK -->
    <section>
        <h2>V. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE WORK </h2>
		<p>To suggest that social media users should understand the intent of using social media and remain informed about the use of informational sites, as well as the data protection issues at stake with the use of applications. Teenagers must use their time productively on social media to improve social connectivity rather than squandering their valuable time on informal chats and posts in WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. To ensure the future of children, teachers and parents should look for what they are truly doing[1].</p>
		<p>Teachers must introduce new techniques to allow students to get support from instructional platforms for their assessments and tutorials in order to inculcate the practice of using social media for academic purposes[10]. </p>
		<p>That time is spent by young people using cell phones and browsing the Internet can be reduced by setting plans for their everyday lives. Parents or guardians must do this to protect their child from abuse of social media. Academic institutions must not regulate educational opportunities[10].</p>
		<p>Influence and obsession on social media are much worse than the fascination with tobacco[30]. Young people actually the most popular user of social media, encounter the issue of fear, anxiety, poor self-esteem, depression, and they are scared of being emotionally abused, criticized, or even ignored if they encounter people and improve their social connections such that they usually spend their time using smartphones and browsing through various public contact platforms[16].</p>

    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>This section details the rationale behind the chosen HTML structure for the academic paper "Impact of Social Media On Youth". Each choice is carefully curated to ensure semantic relevance, improve accessibility, and enhance the overall readability of the document.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Title of the Paper</h3>
        <p>The title "Impact of Social Media On Youth" uses the &lt;h1&gt; tag, which denotes the main title of a document or a section of a document. As this tag represents the top level heading, it is semantically correct to use it for the paper's title.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Author Details</h3>
        <p>The author name uses the &lt;h2&gt; tag, signifying its importance as the second highest level of heading after the title. The &lt;address&gt; tag wraps the department, university, location, and email details. This tag is specifically intended for marking up contact information. The email address is enclosed in an &lt;a&gt; tag with a "mailto:" href attribute, making it a clickable email link.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Sections and Subsections</h3>
        <p>Sections like "Abstract", "Introduction", "Literature Review", and so forth, are wrapped in individual &lt;section&gt; elements to semantically group content together. Each section's title is represented by an &lt;h2&gt; tag, ensuring clear hierarchy and improving navigation. The subsections within these sections use &lt;h3&gt;tags (we didn't have sub-sub sections to h3 suffices) ensuring hierarchical and logical representation of headings and subheadings. The paragraphs under the headings are, for obvious reasons, surrouned by the &lt;p&gt; tags.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Paragraphs and Content</h3>
        <p>Regular text content within each section is wrapped in &lt;p&gt; tags, which denote paragraphs. This ensures proper spacing and distinction between distinct blocks of text, improving readability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>References</h3>
        <p>The "References" section employs an ordered list &lt;ol&gt; with each reference enclosed in a &lt;li&gt; tag. This structure is used because academic references are often sequentially numbered. Each entry in the bibliography has a clear order, making an ordered list the most semantically accurate choice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Additional Stylistic or Semantic Elements</h3>
		<p>Additional tags are used for several tasks, such as &lt;i&gt; used to italicize the heading, &lt;em&gt; tags are used to surround the keywords since they carry a weight and are important for a research paper, etc. Tags for images and tables are not used since there were none in the chosen paper. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Each HTML tag is carefully selected to ensure relevance and representation of the educational content. The structure is designed to ensure the integrity and presentation of the paper that is easy to read and navigate. Applying these options ensures easy compatibility of the web page with the tool and maintains an accurate, hierarchical representation of the document content.</p>
